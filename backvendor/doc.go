// Package backvendor provides a way to represent Go source code in a
// filesystem, and taken from a source code repository. It allows
// mapping vendored packages back to the original versions they came
// from.
//
// A GoSource represents a filesystem tree containing Go source
// code. Create it using NewGoSource or FindGoSources. The Project and
// VendoredProjects methods return information about the top-level
// project and the vendored projects it has.
//
//     src := backvendor.NewGoSource(path, nil)
//     proj, perr := src.Project(importPath)
//     vendored, verr := src.VendoredProjects()
//
// Both of these methods use RepoPath to describe the projects. If a
// glide configuration file is found, Version will be filled in for
// each vendored dependency.
//
// The FindGoSources function looks for Go source code in the provided
// path. If it is not found there, the immediate subdirectories are
// searched. This function allows for repositories which are
// collections of independently-vendored projects.
//
// The DescribeProject function takes a RepoPath and returns a
// Representation, indicating the upstream version of the project or
// vendored project, e.g.
//
//     ref, rerr := backvendor.DescribeProject(proj, src.Path)
//
// It does this by comparing file hashes of the local files with those
// from commits in the upstream repository.
